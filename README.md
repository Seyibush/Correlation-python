# Correlation-python

In this project, a correlation analysis was conducted to examine the relationship between the variable "gross" and other variables within the movie dataset. The primary objective of this analysis was to assess the correlation coefficient, which quantifies the strength and direction of the association between the gross variable and the remaining variables. By employing this method, valuable insights were obtained regarding the influence of the other variables on the gross variable in the movie dataset.
